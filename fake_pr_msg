The motivation came from reading brettcannon's article : https://snarky.ca/how-to-use-your-project-travis-to-help-test-python-itself/ . Trying to activate the newest Python versions on CI jobs is in most case a win-win situation: if everything works fine, there is nothing to worry about. If an issue is spotted, it is good to know about it to fix it on your side or to open a bug on CPython ( https://bugs.python.org/ ).

Also, if a failures is spotted, you can use the allow_failures option in your matrix build (more information about this in the link above).

Also, nightly and 3.7-dev may be a bit too recent/unstable so I can remove then if need be.
